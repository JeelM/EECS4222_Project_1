# Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
In recent years, it has become the de-facto standard for cluster management in the cloud. We will be using kubernetes to manage our infrastructure and deploy
our applications. In this section of the tutorial, you will learn to deploy kubernetes to a create a cluster comprising of VMs that can be managed from a single point which is the master node.


## Installing Required Tools

Before installing Kubernetes, we need to install some tools that we will be using later on.

### Docker

You might need docker for local development of containers before deploying
them to Kubernetes. So, we recommend that you install Docker on the **master**
VM to have the tools available to you. **Notice** that seeing errors in this section (setting the permissions for Docker) is OK.

```sh
# install docker
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
# fix the user permissions for running docker seeing errors in this section is OK
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo chown "$USER":"$USER" /home/"$USER"/.docker -R
sudo chmod g+rwx "/home/$USER/.docker" -R
sudo chown "$USER":"$USER" /var/run/docker.sock
sudo chmod g+rwx /var/run/docker.sock -R
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

Test you docker installation by running the following:

```sh
(master) $ docker ps
(master) $ docker version
```

Which should yield a result like the following:

```console
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES

### Arkade and Other Tools

[Arkade](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade) Is a tool that can be used to simplify the
process of installing several applications and components necessary for interacting with
kubernetes clusters. You can learn more about Arkade by reading [this blog post](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/openfaas-arkade/).

Other tools we will be using for this installation are [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/), [helm](https://helm.sh/), and [k3sup](https://k3sup.dev/). `Kubectl` is the tool that we will
use to interact with our kubernetes cluster. `Helm` is the most used package manager for kubernetes, which
simplifies the process of installing and updating kubernetes applications. `K3sup` is a tool that simplifies
the process of setting up our kubernetes cluster with minimal effort.

To install the Arkade and some other tools that you might need for interacting with your cluster,
you can use the following installation scripts on the **master** VM:

```sh
# install arkade
curl -sLS https://dl.get-arkade.dev | sudo sh
# Add tools bin directory to PATH
echo "export PATH=\$HOME/.arkade/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
# Copy bash completion script
arkade completion bash > ~/.arkade_bash_completion.sh
echo "source ~/.arkade_bash_completion.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
# Kubectl
arkade get kubectl
# Kubectl bash completion
echo 'source <(kubectl completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
# Helm
arkade get helm
# k3sup
arkade get k3sup
# move kubectl to /usr/bin to allow it to be used in python later on
sudo cp ~/.arkade/bin/kubectl /usr/bin/ && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/kubectl
# Add helm and k3sup to your PATH variable
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.arkade/bin/

```

You can test your installation using following commands. **Notice** that the error shown for `kubectl version` is not important, as we have not yet installed our kubernetes cluster.

```console
$ arkade version
$ helm version
$ kubectl version
$ k3sup version


### Optional Tools

For special installations, you might need `skaffold` which can be installed using the following command. However, for most students this step is not required.

```sh
curl -Lo skaffold https://storage.googleapis.com/skaffold/releases/latest/skaffold-linux-amd64 && sudo install skaffold /usr/local/bin/ && rm skaffold
```

## Installing Kubernetes

For this project, we will be using a lightweight distribution of kubernetes called [k3s](https://k3s.io/).
K3s is a lightweight distribution of Kubernetes created at [Rancher Labs](https://rancher.com/). Basically, it is a complete 
Kubernetes distribution, but they combined all processes into a single binary, added cross-compilation for ARM, dropped a lot of 
extra features that you don’t normally use and bundled some extra user-space tools. To install k3s on the master, run the
following commands on the master VM:

```sh
# run the following commands on your master VM
# create kubeconfig directory
mkdir ~/.kube
# master information
export MASTER_IP=192.168.0.100
# install k3s
k3sup install \
  --local \
  --k3s-channel stable \
  --local-path ~/.kube/config \
  --k3s-extra-args "--node-external-ip $MASTER_IP --node-ip $MASTER_IP --bind-address $MASTER_IP --disable traefik --write-kubeconfig-mode 644" \
  --print-command
```

If everything goes smoothly, you should see an output like the following:

```console

# Test your cluster with:
export KUBECONFIG=/home/ubuntu/.kube/config
kubectl config use-context default
kubectl get node -o wide
```

You can check out your installation using the following command:

```sh
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

Which should yield an output like the following:

```console
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME                  STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION        INTERNAL-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION     CONTAINER-RUNTIME
ktest-eecs6446        Ready    control-plane,master   6s    v1.20.0+k3s2   192.168.0.100        <none>        Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS   5.4.0-56-generic   containerd://1.4.3-k3s1
```

The status shown as `Ready` shows everything went smoothly and we have completely set up our master node.
Now, we need to have our other nodes (workers) join the kubernetes cluster. To do so, you need `k3sup` installed
on your laptop. To do so, download k3sup executable from its [release page](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup/releases) 
for windows, or run the following for MacOS and Linux:

```sh
curl -sLS https://get.k3sup.dev | sudo sh
```

Next, you need to have the `worker node` join your kubernetes cluster. Run the following
commands on `Cluster head`.

```sh
# master information
export MASTER_IP=192.168.0.100
export MASTER_USER=eecs
# worker information
export WORKER_IP=192.168.0.101
export WORKER_USER=eecs
k3sup join --ip $WORKER_IP --user $WORKER_USER --server-ip $MASTER_IP --server-user $MASTER_USER --k3s-extra-args "--node-external-ip $WORKER_IP --node-ip $WORKER_IP" --k3s-channel stable --print-command
```

In case you did not include your private and public keys in the default path (`~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`), you need to specify them whenever you want to connect with your remote VM. In order to do so, you need to perform the **join** command in the following way, setting the `KEY_LOCATION` to the path to your private key:

```sh
# set your key location here
export KEY_LOCATION="/PATH/TO/YOUR/PRIVATE_KEY"

k3sup join --ip $WORKER_IP \
    --user $WORKER_USER \
    --server-ip $MASTER_IP \
    --server-user $MASTER_USER \
    --k3s-extra-args "--node-external-ip $WORKER_IP --node-ip $WORKER_IP" \
    --k3s-channel stable \
    --print-command \
    --ssh-key $KEY_LOCATION
```

If everything goes as planned, you should see an output like the following:

```sh
$ k3sup join --ip $WORKER_IP --user $WORKER_USER --server-ip $MASTER_IP --server-user $MASTER_USER --k3s-extra-args "--node-external-ip $WORKER_IP --node-ip $WORKER_IP" --k3s-channel stable --print-command

We should also be able to see the new worker node added to the cluster by running the following on the `master`:

```sh
(master) $ kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME                   STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION        INTERNAL-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION     CONTAINER-RUNTIME

ktest2-eecs6446        Ready    <none>                 31s   v1.20.0+k3s2   192.168.0.101        192.168.0.101        Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS   5.4.0-56-generic   containerd://1.4.3-k3s1
```

Notice the `Ready` status for both VMs.

Now that our cluster is set up and ready to use, we can proceed to the [next step](03-microservice.md). You can check
out some of the most used `kubectl` commands on [their documentations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/).
You can also take a look at the [kubectl cheatsheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/).
