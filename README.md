# EECS4222: Distributed Computing Systems: Project 1 (20%)
**Title:** Autoscaling for Microservices in Cloud
**Start:** Feb 5, 2023, @ 9:00am EST   
**Due:** Feb 26, 2023, by 9:00pm EST

Welcome to `EECS4222` course project. In this project, you will deploy a sample
application based on microservice architecture on a `Kubernetes` cluster. Then you exercise various
pre-defined autoscaling strategies to handle/investigate flactuations in the applied workload to your cluster.

In fact, this project is like a tutorial that you need to follow the steps mentioned in 
the below table.

At the end of each step, you will see a list of references that may help you gain a better
understanding of the elements and concepts in that part.

Here is the table of contents for phase 1:
